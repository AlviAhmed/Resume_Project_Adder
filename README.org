Checking some script execution times 

Snippet used to run each script 1000 times

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
time ( for x in $(seq 1000); do  
bash V1.sh 
done)
#+END_SRC


* V1 
- user input: C++
- grep on original file 
- conditional
- Awk on original file

*#1*

real	0m8.303s

user	0m6.445s

sys	0m3.456s

*#2*

real	0m8.442s

user	0m6.454s

sys	0m3.589s

*#3*

real	0m8.472s

user	0m6.646s

sys	0m3.500s

*Avg:* 

real: 8.405666 

user: 6.515

sys:  3.515

* V2 
- user input: C++ 
- Awk func on original file
- Grep on buffer file
- Conditional 

*#1*

real	0m8.464s

user	0m6.461s

sys	0m3.745s

*#2*

real	0m8.426s

user	0m6.430s

sys	0m3.747s

*#3*

real	0m7.742s

user	0m6.118s

sys	0m3.088s

*Avg* 

real: 8.210666 

user: 6.3363333 

sys: 3.52666


* Conclusion 

For now it is a bit faster to awk on the original file, transfer
matched to a buffer and then grep to determine how many projects
present.
